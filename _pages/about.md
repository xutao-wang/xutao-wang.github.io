I'm Xutao Wang, Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/), at Boston University. I am under supervision of [W. Evan Johnson](https://phri.njms.rutgers.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty/evan-johnson/) from [the Public Health Research Institute at New Jersey Medical School](https://phri.njms.rutgers.edu/) and [Prasad Patil](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/prasad-patil/) from BU Biostatistics. Previously, I received M.S. in [Computational Biology & Quantitative Genetics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/sm-computational-biology/) from Department of Biostatistcs, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, under supervision of [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/giovanni-parmigiani/). I obtained Honors B.S. with High Distinction in Statistics and Molecular Biology from University of Toronto, Canada.

**I am looking for jobs now!**

My research focuses on developing and applying computational methodologies in transcriptomic
data, especially in studying genomic biomarkers for tuberculosis diagnostics and combining mod-
els trained in heterogeneous data. Major research topics include:
- Infectious disease diagnostics
- Biomarker analysis
- Domain generalization
- Breast cancer research in African American women
I broadly collaborate with researchers from *Uganda*, *India*, and *Brazil* to study the host interface
of tuberculosis (TB), with a focus on reproducibility and replicability of TB genomic biomarkers.
