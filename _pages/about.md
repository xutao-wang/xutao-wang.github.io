I am Xutao Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/) at Boston University, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. W. Evan Johnson](https://phri.njms.rutgers.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty/evan-johnson/) from the Department of Medicine at New Jersey Medical School and [Dr. Prasad Patil](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/prasad-patil/) from the Department of Biostatistics at Boston University. Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Science degree in [Computational Biology](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/sm-computational-biology/) from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, under the guidance of [Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/giovanni-parmigiani/). I earned my Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Statistics and Molecular Biology, from the University of Toronto, Canada.

My research focuses on developing and applying computational methodologies in transcriptomic
data, especially in studying genomic biomarkers for tuberculosis diagnostics and combining models trained in heterogeneous data. Major research topics include:
- Infectious disease diagnostics
- Biomarker analysis
- Domain generalization
- Breast cancer research
